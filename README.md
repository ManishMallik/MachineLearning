# Machine Learning Assignment 1
There are two Python files to run: part1.py and part2.py

- part1.py contains code that takes a URL and retrieves a dataset. With that dataset, it will train a multivariate linear regression model, which we make manually, and test it. To run it, run the following script in the command line:
  python part1.py

- part2.py does the same as part1.py, except it will use a library to train a linear regression model and test it. To run it, run the following script in the command line:
  python part2.py

Additionally, try running importing both of these files in Google Collab and run them
