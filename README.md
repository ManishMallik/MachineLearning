# Machine Learning Assignment 1
There are two Python files to run: part1.py and part2.py

- part1.py contains code that takes a URL and retrieves a dataset. With that dataset, it will train a multivariate linear regression model, which we make manually, and test it. To compile and run it, run the following script in the command line: python part1.py
- Libraries used: numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn.metrics (only for computing r^2 and explained variance)

- part2.py does the same as part1.py, except it will use a library to train a linear regression model and test it. To compile and run it, run the following script in the command line: python part2.py
- Libraries used: numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn.metrics, sklearn.preprocessing, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.linear_model, seaborn

Additionally, try importing both of these files in Google Collab and run them

**Important note -> we retrieved the dataset by using this URL in our code: "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/auto-mpg/auto-mpg.data"
